                We don't see each other anymore, but I hope everything is okay.
                You're growing to become the intelligent woman I know you can be.
                I'm so fortunate to have a friend like you who's gentle, loving, and sweet.
                
                Today should be a day of pure happiness and love for you,
                Enjoying and gathering with those who remain devoted and true.
                I wish you the best in life, though we both know how hard it can be,
                But I pray that God will open your doors to brighter opportunities.

                We are miles away from each other, but the love we share will never end.
                Never seeing you again will always be a difficult test,
                But our everlasting friendship is what I will never forget.
                
                I won't forget about all the things you've brought to my years:
                Long-lasting laughter and contenting cheers.
                I never knew that all of these blessings could all come true,
                But my life has been better, and it's all because of you.
